		<string>The Athlete’s Foot has become the market leader in performance footwear via our ‘All For Customer’ ethos. Through outstanding customer service, excellent product range, and an unwavering commitment to FIT, TAF offers a customer experience without peer in our industry.

At a time when consumers are both time poor and value conscious, but well educated and digitally connected, we are continually challenged to demonstrate clearly why walking into a TAF store is the only choice for customers who value the Fit and Function of their footwear, via a warm and engaging experience.

TAF have led on FIT for over 25 years. Be it through the introduction of the Brannock, the establishment of Fit University, or the ground breaking innovation of Fitprint, we have strived to equip our Fit technicians the with skills and resources with which to fit every foot, and guarantee satisfaction as a result.

Disappointingly, all good things must come to an end - Fitprint has served TAF exceptionally well for over 12 years, but in recent times the wow factor has been lost and customers no longer feel excited to run through the Fitprint process. Our own research indicated that not only did customers desire something new, so did our supplier partners and the podiatry community.

		<string>We had a very clear vision of how to ensure TAF remained at the vanguard of Fitting technology within the performance footwear space and 2 years ago we started scouring the world for the best technologies to help us achieve this. The result of this long and detailed search is FITZI, and we are absolutely delighted with the outcome.In Fitzi we have evolved Dynamic screen and incorporated Video, a powerful combination that provides the best technology experience in the industry – and when couples with a focus on foot and shoe shape, will give staff and customers alike total confidence in our product selection. Fitzi is the biggest innovation TAF has brought to market in a long time. Whilst it has evolved from Fitprint, many elements are new, or will feel knew to you as Fit Technicians, and so I strongly encourage you to wink your teeth into the training material and resources available, and learn how to get the most out of it for your customers.Good luckGeoff WebsterSales &amp; Merchandise DirectorThe Athlete’s Foot</string>

		<string>Fit can mean many things, you are in good health, you are fit for the job, or it is fit for use...  

At The Athlete’s Foot FIT has its own identity, its own definition. FIT means ensuring that our customer’s shoes FIT their activity, foot shape, biomechanical and comfort needs and requirements. 

Based on this definition, a thorough knowledge and understanding of what it takes to get the best FIT is the reason TAF staff are viewed as the Fitting Experts. 

By continually asking ourselves “what does it take to achieve the Perfect Fit?” TAF has been able to stay ahead of its competitors. In order to achieve the Perfect Fit, you, our Fit Technician’s have needed to be able to identify the following elements:•  Forefoot Shapes 

•  Foot conditions &amp; their considerations

•  How to accurately capture the customer’s foot measurements

•  How to identify the different Arch Types

•   How to capture your customers needs and requirements in a conversational manner         through the qualifying process
